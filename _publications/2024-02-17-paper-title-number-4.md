### [Where Should Philly Build New bike Share Stations?: Predicting and Evaluating for Philadelphia's Bike Share Expansion]( https://indegoexpansion.web.app/)

[Indego](https://www.rideindego.com/), Philadelphia's bike share system, wants to expand their network to increase ridership (revenue), accessibility, and equity. To help Indegeo evaluate different expansion plans, we created [Station Planner](https://indegoexpansion.web.app/). As our team's machine learning lead, I built a model that predicts areas of high and low ridership across Philadelphia.  Powered by these predictions, our interactive tool lets planners place new bike stations on the map to see what expected future ridership, accessibility, and equity looks like for the system.

This project was produced as part of the [University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Master of Urban Spatial Analytics (MUSA) Spring 2023 Practicum course](https://pennmusa.github.io/MUSA_801.io/) with my colleagues [Minwook Kang](https://mintheworld.com/) and Aidan Rhianne.
